Alchemy Git Collaboration Kata
==============================

![Alchemy](doc/alchemy_icon.png)

### Instructions

> Hello, git apprentices! This is your initial test to become alchemists. To pass the test, you must tell me how each
component works, and then mix them into the mighty _white component_! 


This is a git Kata. Each team must have three pairs of programmers (blue, green and red). 
- The **blue** pair must fork this repository and create the team's **remote repo**.
- Each team can *only* work on its color component.
- Complete your component's code to pass the failing test. Then you can push your changes.
- The first pair in the team can try to fabricate the **white** component.
 
 
#### Components 

Each component has a _power_ level, that depends on two parameters: the number of drops in the vial and the number of
seconds it remains in the vial.


##### The Mighty White Component

> To create the white component, the team must know how each color component works

This is, to pass the White Component Test you need to pass all the previous tests first!
